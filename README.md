# SimpleContactRelatedList
A basic example of how to create a custom related list of Contacts, to be used on an Account layout in Salesforce!

This example uses a VisualForce page that uses the Account object as a standard controller and is designed with the Google Materialize styling.

To add this page to your Account page layout, go to an Account record in Salesforce, click 'Edit Layout' in the top right, select 'VisualForce Pages' from the menu on the left hand side and then finally just drag the page onto the layout.

It is best to add a new section to the page with a single column layout and then drag the page into the new section - be sure to double click the VisualForce page when added and set the height to 500px and to check the checkbox for 'Enable Scrollbars'.
